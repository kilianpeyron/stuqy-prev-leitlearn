# Stuqy

## New version
The active, maintained version is available at [Stuqy.com](https://Stuqy.com).

This new version has been completely rewritten with a much more modern and robust stack:
- **Next.js** framework (App Router + Server Components)
- **Prisma ORM** for type-safe, efficient and maintainable database interactions
- Advanced CI/CD pipeline with automated tests, linting, type-checking, and **automatic deployment to Vercel on every tag** (`vX.Y.Z` → instant production deploy via GitHub Actions + Vercel integration)

## Project Status

- Rebranding: In addition to development, I am contributing to a full rebranding effort.
- Maintenance & Fixes: Existing maintenance is on hold, and only critical issues will be addressed if necessary, allowing me to focus on the large-scale feature work and overhaul.
